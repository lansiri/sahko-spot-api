Welcome to the **S√§hk√∂ spot js**, the only tool you'll ever need to ride the lightning of fluctuating electricity prices! Powered by the arcane arts of JavaScript and fueled by the mystical energies of `api.spot-hinta.fi`, this script is your crystal ball into the future of electricity pricing.

## Features

- **Temporal Precision**: Gaze into the future with our 6-hour foresight feature. Why live in the now when you can prepare for the next 6 hours?
- **Visual Delights**: Behold the beauty of our line charts, as they undulate like the northern lights, charting the course of electricity prices in hues of light blue and deep blue.
- **Colorful Warnings**: Witness our charts blush in slight embarrassment with shades of red when they reveal the two most expensive hours. It's not bad news; it's an adventure!
- **Time Wizardry**: With our SetTimer function, you'll never lose track of the relentless march of time. It's like having a pocket watch, but much cooler because it's digital.
